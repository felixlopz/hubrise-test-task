  title: Food Ordering Platforms | SOLUTION | HubRise
  description: Integrating SOLUTION with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

With HubRise, you can receive orders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and other food platforms in SOLUTION. You can also push your menu from SOLUTION to food platforms.

This page describes the settings to use to connect food ordering platforms to SOLUTION.

For more information, check the documentation of these platforms in our [Apps page](/apps/food-ordering-platforms).

## Configuration on SOLUTION

Depending on your needs, you will need to create PRODUCTS, PROMOTIONS, PAYMENT METHODS... specific to the platforms in SOLUTION.

If you don't use these features, you can skip the creation of these items, and leave the corresponding fields empty.

### PRODUCTS, PROMOTIONS...

Describe the items to create before connecting food platforms.

## Deliveroo

To receive Deliveroo orders in SOLUTION, you first need to connect Deliveroo Bridge, an app included in your HubRise subscription. For more information about Deliveroo Bridge, see the [Deliveroo Bridge documentation](/apps/deliveroo/overview).

In the Deliveroo Bridge configuration page, use the following settings:

| Section        | Name                                  | Ref code                                          |

## Just Eat

Just Eat offers two APIs:

- The Flyt API is used on the Just-Eat.co.uk, Just-Eat.ie, Menulog and SkipTheDishes platforms, and for chains on other markets. This API allows you to synchronise the orders and the menu.
- The Takeaway API, the older one, is used for independents on other markets. It allows you to receive orders, but not to send the menu.

If you are not sure which API to use, contact support@hubrise.com.
