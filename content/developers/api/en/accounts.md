**Note:** the `timezone.offset` field is deprecated and should not be used, as it does not take daylight saving time into account.

#### Opening Hours {#opening-hours}

The `opening_hours` field represents the opening hours for a location on each day of the week: `monday`, `tuesday`, etc. You can provide multiple time slots for each day, specifying the `from` and `to` times in the `HH:mm` format. For example:

```json
{
  "opening_hours": {
    "monday": [
      {
        "from": "12:00",
        "to": "14:00"
      },
      {
        "from": "18:00",
        "to": "01:00" // Next day because 01:00 is before the cutoff time (= 06:00)
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can skip some days, in which case the location will be considered closed on those days, but at least one time slot must be provided for the week.

For each time slot, `to` must follow `from`. Additionally, there must be no overlap between time slots of the same day.

The `cutoff_time` is a location level field, with a default value of `06:00`. It allows time slots to span across midnight. In the example above, the second time slot ends at `01:00`, which is considered on the same day as `18:00`, because `01:00` is before the `cutoff_time`. If the `cutoff_time` was `00:00`, `01:00` would be considered on the next day and the API would return an error.

### 1.2 Update Location

Updates a location.

<CallSummaryTable
  endpoint="PATCH /locations/:id"
  shortEndpoint="PATCH /location (location only)"
  accessLevel="location, account"
/>

The following fields can be updated: `cutoff_time`, `opening_hours`, and `custom_fields`.
