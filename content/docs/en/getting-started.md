## Accounts and Locations

An **Account** identifies your brand. **Locations** refers to the point of sales within this brand, they typically correspond to physical outlets.

A small business may have one Account with one Location, while a larger business may have one Account with multiple Locations tied to the same Account.

If you want to get an overall view of an Account's performance, select all Locations. If you want to narrow results to one Location within an Account, select the Account then the corresponding Location.
