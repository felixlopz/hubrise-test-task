Permissions are a way to control the actions that Users can take on your Account and Locations. You can change the permissions level for a User by assigning different roles from the **Permissions** section in the **SETTINGS** page.

## HubRise Roles

HubRise supports two roles: Admins and Managers.

- **Admins** have access to all areas of HubRise, including invoices. They are responsible for keeping the payment information up to date. They will receive invoices by email when a payment is made or notifications regarding HubRise pending payments. They can also grant access to other users and disconnect apps from HubRise.
- **Managers** have access to all areas except HubRise invoices. They will not receive notifications emails on outstanding payments to HubRise. They can connect apps to HubRise but not disconnect them.

You can also view and edit your own permissions from your User profile. For more information, see [Profile and Password](/docs/profile-password).

## Add a User {#add-user}

Admins can grant access to other users provided they have an existing profile on HubRise. New HubRise users can create a profile in the [HubRise signup page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). If you create a new profile on someone else's behalf, use the [HubRise Reset password page](https://manager.hubrise.com/reset_password/new) to have the user enter their own secure password.

To grant a User permissions on an Account, follow these steps:

1. Select **SETTINGS**.
1. In the **Permissions** section, enter the User's email address in the column marked **EMAIL**.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: An account cannot be left without Admin. Before you remove your user profile from an Account make sure there is an Admin user with permissions. If not, you can change permissions of an existing user or give Admin permissions to **test@hubrise.com**.
