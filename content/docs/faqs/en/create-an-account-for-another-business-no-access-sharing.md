If you are a software provider, a reseller or a consultant, you may wish to create an account for your customer on HubRise without sharing access to the HubRise back office. There could be several reasons for this. For instance, you may be offering HubRise as a white-label service, or your client may be paying for a full service and doesn't want or need access.

To create an account for another business without giving them access :

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Click your name in the top right corner, then click **Profile**.
1. In the **Permissions** section, click **Create Account**.
1. Proceed with the account creation process as usual. For more information, see [Create an Account](/docs/account#create-account).

The account will be created without any additional users.
