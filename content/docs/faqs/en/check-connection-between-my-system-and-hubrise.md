There are a few different ways of verifying that the connection between your system or app to HubRise is working properly. The first step for all of these recommendations is to log in to HubRise through the [HubRise Login page](https://manager.hubrise.com/login).

## Check the Orders Coming In

If orders are being made in a connected app, they can be viewed in HubRise through the following process:

1. Click **ORDERS**.
1. If you have access to multiple Accounts, select the Account you need to see.
1. To see all Orders going through the Account, verify **All locations** is selected. You could select the location you want to view from the **Location** list to narrow the search down.
1. If transactions are coming through you will see them here. Orders are displayed in reverse chronological order.

For more details, see [Orders](/docs/data/#orders).

## View the App Activity

Each app displays the most recent activity as a graph. To check the activity for a specific app:

1. Click **CONNECTIONS**.
1. For the specific App, click **Actions** > **View activity**.

For more information, see [View Connection Activity](/docs/connections/#view-connection-activity).

## View the App Logs

Apps connected to HubRise provide logs that help display the most recent requests, and the details behind it. To view an App's log files:

1. For the specific App, click **Actions** > **View logs**.
