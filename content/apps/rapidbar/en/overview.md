## Description

RapidBar simplifies your restaurant, bar or hotel inventory management. Whether you have one location or a chain, RapidBar adapts and allows you to centrally manage all your stock data in one cloud-based platform.

Managers can access a fully featured back office application to manage stock and track key performance indicators (KPIs). RapidBar eliminates common inventory challenges such as stock shortages and surplus, and helps to stay on top of cost fluctuations and labor shortages.

RapidBar's mobile app is also an easy-to-use counting tool and does not require any special training. It eliminates the need for spreadsheet usage, transcription mistakes, and human error in copying data.

RapidBar key features include:

- **Products**: You can store all of your ingredients in your own database, and access insightful data such as weights and Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) through RapidBar's community database.
- **Recipes**: You can use RapidBar to calculate recipe costs and related margins in real-time, create batch recipes, and print them for your staff to follow.
- **Supply**: You can add unlimited suppliers, receive automatic supplier order suggestions to optimise inventory levels, and include received orders to your inventory.
- **Reporting**: You have access to customisable reporting capabilities to help make informed decisions.
- **Onboarding**: You will receive personalised onboarding support to fully utilise RapidBar and make most of your investment.
