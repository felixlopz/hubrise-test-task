Most EPOS solutions require a ref code for each product to correctly parse orders. Therefore, you need to make sure that each product on Shopify is assigned to the correct ref code.

This page explains how to configure ref codes manually in Shopify. Some EPOS solutions however offer the ability to export their catalog to HubRise, allowing you to populate Shopify products automatically with the correct ref codes. For more details, see [Pulling the Catalog](/apps/shopify/pulling-catalog).

To assign ref codes to your Shopify products, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Shopify back office.
1. From the menu, select **Products** > **All products**.
1. From the list of products, select the product for which you want to add the ref code.
1. In the **Inventory** section, enter the ref code in the **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** field.

1. Click **Save** to confirm.

You will need to repeat this manual procedure for all your available items.
