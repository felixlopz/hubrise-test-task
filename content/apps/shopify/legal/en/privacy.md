**Shopify Bridge** ("the App") provides an integration service with 3rd party applications ("the Service") to merchants who
use Shopify to power their stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared
when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.

### Personal Information the App Collects

When you install the App, we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account:

- Your orders
- Your catalog of products

Additionally, we collect the following types of personal information from your customers once you have installed the App:

- Name
- Delivery address
- Email address
- Phone number

We collect personal information directly through the Shopify API.

### How Do We Use Your Customers Personal Information?

We use the personal information we collect from your customers in order to provide the Service and to operate the App.
The information is only shared with the apps you have explicitly approved from the HubRise back-office.

### Sharing Your Personal Information

We don't share your Personal Information with any third party services.
We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
