## Description

OrderWire is a modern restaurant management system and Point of Sale application designed from the ground-up for the delivery world. 100% web-based, OrderWire supports many deployment configurations from the simple coffee-shops to multi-location chains. With OrderWire, delivery channels are first-class citizens, and via integration with HubRise, restaurants gain an end-to-end view of their sales and costs, including food cost and channel commission.

Ideally suited for ghost and cloud kitchen environments, multiple physical or virtual locations are fully supported.

Flexible web-based deployment and a generous free tier make getting started easy.

Core OrderWire features include:

- Order input and payments for both on-premises and online channels.
- Multi-location (traditional and ghost kitchen) support with optionally shared data.
- Built-In Kitchen Display (KDS).
- Dynamic order routing from all channels into kitchen displays.
- Drag-and-drop menu builder.
- Adjustable Pricelists to manage menu pricing.
- Smart product definition with variants and multi-level options and modifiers.
- Nutritional, allergen, and dietary tags.
- Ingredient-level costing of product recipes.
- Inventory management.
- Easy online store setup, including menu and inventory synchronisation.
- Custom notification events via SMS and email.
- Support for leading printers, including Epson TM, Star MC, Citizen, and Fujitsu.
