## What does "Item may be missing" on receipts mean?

If a product or option ref code is missing or not recognised on an order that HubRise sends to MyOrderBox, the following note is included at the bottom of the order receipt.

![Invalid ref code in MyOrderBox receipt](../images/001-invalid-ref-code.png)

To resolve the issue, check the ref code of the missing product or option. See [Map Ref Codes](/apps/myorderbox/map-ref-codes).

## MyOrderBox Support

MyOrderBox support team can be contacted at [support@myorderboxhq.com ](mailto:support@myorderboxhq.com) for issues with the configuration of the EPOS.
