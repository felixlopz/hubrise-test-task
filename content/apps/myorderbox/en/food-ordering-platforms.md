  description: Integrating MyOrderBox with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.
---

With HubRise, you can receive orders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and other food platforms in MyOrderBox. You can also push your menu from MyOrderBox to food platforms.

This page describes the settings to use to connect food ordering platforms to MyOrderBox.

For more information, check the documentation of these platforms in our [Apps page](/apps/food-ordering-platforms).

## Configuration on MyOrderBox

### Virtual Brands

MyOrderBox uses service type ref codes to identify the source of orders. To connect several virtual brands to a single MyOrderBox EPOS, you need to include virtual brand identification information in the service type ref codes. To connect a single brand, just use the service type ref codes provided in the sections below.

For example, to connect Deliveroo:

- If you operate a single Deliveroo account, use `DLO` as the service type ref code
- If you operate multiple Deliveroo accounts, look up the virtual brand id for the account you need to connect in MyOrderBox. If the id is `123456789`, the service type ref code you need to enter is `DLO_123456789`.

To find a virtual brand id:

1. Log in to your [MyOrderBox back office](https://go.myorderboxhq.com/).
1. Check that no store is selected in the store selector dropdown at the top. If a store is selected, click on the cross icon to unselect. If you cannot unselect the store, check that you have account manager permissions.
1. From the navigation menu, select **Management** > **Menu** > **Virtual Brands** > **Products**.
1. Open the **Virtual brand** dropdown.
1. The virtual brand id is the number next to the brand name, after the **-** character.

In the Deliveroo Bridge configuration page, use the following settings:

| Order statuses | Mark orders as Accepted               | `when their HubRise status changes to "Accepted"`          |

## Just Eat

Just Eat offers two APIs:

- The Flyt API is used on the Just-Eat.co.uk, Just-Eat.ie, Menulog and SkipTheDishes platforms, and for chains on other markets. This API allows you to synchronise the orders and the menu.
- The Takeaway API, the older one, is used for independents on other markets. It allows you to receive orders, but not to send the menu.

If you are not sure which API to use, contact [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com).
