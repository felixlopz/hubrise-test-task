## Description

My Lemonade is a table ordering solution. Customers flash the QR code or use the NFC tag placed on their table to access the menu on their smartphone and order. Customer can choose to pay directly on the app or with the waiter. The menu displays in the customer's language and there is nothing to install.

My Lemonade also offers a web back office to update the menu of your restaurant, set promotional periods, edit your settings, and use features like room management, service activation, and presence validation to limit the risk of no-shows and abusive orders.

A Kitchen Display System is available to restaurants without EPOS integration to receive orders and update product availabilities.
