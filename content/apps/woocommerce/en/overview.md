## Description

WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, specifically tailored for online merchants ranging from small to large-sized businesses. This platform enables businesses to sell both digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, process secure payments, and automatically handle taxes.

WooCommerce operates as a plugin that requires installation on a WordPress website. Despite providing a broad range of features natively, you have the option to enhance WooCommerce's functionality. This can be achieved through themes, additional plugins, extensions, or even by modifying the plugin's code directly.

Since its launch in 2011, WooCommerce has become the most prevalent e-commerce solution. By 2020, it powered 4 out of every 10 online ordering websites, solidifying its position as a leading player in the online marketplace.

## Integration Features

Connecting WooCommerce Bridge allows HubRise to:

- Pull orders from WooCommerce, including order status.
- Pull customer information from WooCommerce.
- Push a catalog into WooCommerce.

## Why Connect?

WooCommerce can be connected to HubRise for your website and other apps you use every day to work as a cohesive whole. It could be your EPOS or your preferred marketing solution. Connecting with HubRise allows you to sync your product catalog, your customer and order information.

Thanks to HubRise, synchronise your menu, your customer and order information with your EPOS, online ordering, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management, delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management, loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
