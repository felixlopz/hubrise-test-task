## Description

WooCommerce is an open source e-commerce platform, built on WordPress, designed for small to large-sized online merchants. Businesses can sell digital and physical products, manage inventory and shipping, take secure payments, and sort taxes automatically.

WooCommerce is a plugin that must be installed on a WordPress website. While it offers a lot of features out of the box, you can also expand the functionality of WooCommerce via themes, plugins, extensions, or even by editing the plugin code itself.

WooCommerce was launched in 2011. It is the most widely used e-commerce solution in 2020, powering 4 out of 10 online ordering websites.

## Integration Features

Connecting WooCommerce to HubRise allows WooCommerce to:

- Push orders into HubRise.
- Pull order status from HubRise into WooCommerce.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Pull a product catalog from HubRise.

## Why Connect?

WooCommerce can be connected to HubRise for your website and other apps you use every day to work as a cohesive whole. It could be your EPOS or your preferred marketing solution. Connecting with HubRise allows you to sync your product catalog, your customer and order information.
