  description: Instructions on how to create and edit products in Catalog Manager. Synchronise catalogs between your EPOS and your apps.
---

When you open a Catalog, the **Products** page in the **Edit** view is displayed.
This lists all your products grouped by category. To add a new category, click **New category** and enter a name.

For each product, in the product's details pane you can view and edit the following:

- Product name
- Description
- Images
- Variations, referred to as **SKUs**
- Option Lists

Variations are typically used to provide different versions of the base product, such as sizes or colours. Options allow you to specify optional additional items, such as extras.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Each variation has its own ref code and price which must be entered if you are connecting an EPOS. If a product has no variations, then the ref code for the base product needs to be entered.

After you have created the new product, you can add details to it and relate it to optional items and deals.

## Add or Edit Product Details

- In the **Description** field enter the product description.
- Add one or more photos of the product by clicking on the **+** icon. For food ordering and delivery platforms, we recommend that images should be jpg or png, 1200x800 pixels or larger, with a ratio of 16:9.
- If the product has variations that a customer needs to choose from, select the **multiple SKUs** check box.
  Then, for each variation enter the **SKU Name**, **Price** and **Ref code**.
  If there are no variations, then enter the price and ref code for the product.
- You can include more variations by selecting **+ New SKU**.
