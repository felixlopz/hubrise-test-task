Catalog Manager allows you to manage and edit your HubRise catalogs, for different locations or channels. Catalog Manager is edited by HubRise and can be used free of charge.

Catalog Manager has the following features:

- Create, edit and manage your HubRise catalogs.
- Edit your products, options, deals, discounts and charges.
- Add pictures and descriptions.

This is the first version of Catalog Manager. In a future release, you will also be able to:

- Manage a single catalog with different prices and product availability per channel.
- Make manual changes to a catalog while keeping track of the differences with the original catalog.

Catalog Manager is a cloud based solution, available anywhere. While you can use it from any device, we recommend using a desktop or laptop computer for the best experience.
