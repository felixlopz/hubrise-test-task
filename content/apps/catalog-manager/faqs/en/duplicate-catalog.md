Duplicating a catalog can be useful if you want to create a new catalog based on an existing one, or to make a backup of your catalog.

To duplicate a catalog, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page.
1. Click **Open** next to the Catalog Manager app. Catalog Manager will open in a new browser tab.
1. Find the catalog you want to duplicate, open the **Actions** dropdown and select **Duplicate**.
1. Provide a name for the new catalog and click **Duplicate**.

Use clearly identifiable names for your catalogs. For example, if you create a catalog for Uber Eats, you could name it **Uber Eats**. If you create a backup catalog, include **Backup** or **Do not edit!** in the name, to make it clear that it should not be edited.
