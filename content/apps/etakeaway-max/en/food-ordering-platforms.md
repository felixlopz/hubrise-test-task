  description: Integrating eTakeaway Max with food ordering platforms requires you to specify particular ref codes in the configuration page of the delivery platform bridge.

With HubRise, you can receive orders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and other food platforms in eTakeaway Max. You can also push your menu from eTakeaway Max to food platforms.

This page describes the settings to use to connect food ordering platforms to eTakeaway Max.

For more information, check the documentation of these platforms in our [Apps page](/apps/food-ordering-platforms).

## Deliveroo

To receive Deliveroo orders in eTakeaway Max, you first need to connect Deliveroo Bridge, an app included in your HubRise subscription. For more information about Deliveroo Bridge, see the [Deliveroo Bridge documentation](/apps/deliveroo).

In the Deliveroo Bridge configuration page, use the following settings:

## Just Eat

Just Eat offers two APIs:

- The Flyt API is used on the Just-Eat.co.uk, Just-Eat.ie, Menulog and SkipTheDishes platforms, and for chains on other markets. This API allows you to synchronise the orders and the menu.
- The Takeaway API, the older one, is used for independents on other markets. It allows you to receive orders, but not to send the menu.

If you are not sure which API to use, contact [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com).
