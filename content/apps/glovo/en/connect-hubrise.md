Connecting Glovo to HubRise can be done with a few steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you do not have a HubRise account yet, register on our [Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

## 1. Enable HubRise on Glovo

As a first step, Glovo support teams must activate the HubRise integration for your stores.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link to your restaurant page on the Glovo website. For example: `https://glovoapp.com/es/en/barcelona/testhubrise123`.
- The contact details of your Glovo account manager.
- Your HubRise location name and identifier. For example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

With this information in hand, we will ask Glovo support to enable the HubRise connection for your store and provide the Glovo ID, for example: `8736550`.

## 2. Map Products Ref Codes

Most apps require products ref codes to process orders correctly. You can either enter products ref codes manually in the Glovo back office, or ask their support team to enter them for you.

## 3. Connect Glovo Bridge

To connect Glovo Bridge to HubRise, follow these steps.

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the location you want to connect from the dropdown menu.
1. Select **CONNECTIONS**, then **View available apps**.
1. Select **Glovo Bridge** from the list of apps.
1. Click **Connect**.
1. Click **Allow** to grant Glovo Bridge permission to access the location of your restaurant registered in HubRise. For accounts with multiple locations, expand the **Choose location** section to select the correct one first, and then click **Allow**.

## 4. Configure Your Preferences

After connecting the bridge, you need to configure a few parameters on the **Configuration** page to send orders correctly to your EPOS.

For more information about the configuration page and how to navigate to it, see [Configuration Page](/apps/glovo/user-interface#configuration) in the User Interface section. For details on how to configure the parameters of Glovo Bridge, see [Configuration](/apps/glovo/configuration).
