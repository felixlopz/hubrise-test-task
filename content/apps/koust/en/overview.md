## Description

Koust is an application for restaurateurs to manage costs and inventory. Koust is designed for all types of food establishments, from independent restaurants to chains and collective catering outlets.

It offers a broad range of features split into different branches:

- The management branch provides dashboards to track your establishment's revenues and margins in real time.
- The stock branch allows you to place procurement orders, carry out inventories and analyse purchases.
- The production branch offers production schedules and semi-finished products tracking.

Koust was created in September 2016. Its main goals are to increase restaurateurs' gross margin, improve productivity and reduce commodity costs.
