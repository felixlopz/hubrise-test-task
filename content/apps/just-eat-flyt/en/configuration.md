## Orders

### Service Types

Service types such as platform delivery, restaurant delivery or takeaway might require the corresponding ref code entry. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to know how to handle discounts in your EPOS.

### Payments

Just Eat customers can pay for their order either online or by cash for restaurant delivery orders.

## Customers

Enable the **Duplicate phone access code in delivery notes** option if your EPOS lacks native support for fetching phone access codes.
