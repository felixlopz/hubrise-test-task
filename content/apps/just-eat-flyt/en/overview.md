Just Eat Flyt Bridge can be connected to HubRise from the HubRise back office.

## Why Connect?

Connecting your Just Eat online restaurant or convenience store to HubRise allows you to receive Just Eat orders directly in your EPOS, your Kitchen Display System or your Delivery Management System also connected with HubRise.
You will be able to manage Just Eat orders alongside other orders, using tools you use every day. Just Eat orders will flow through your existing setup, as all other orders already do.

Via HubRise, synchronise your menu, your customer and order information with your EPOS, online ordering, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management, delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, stock management, loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).

## Prerequisites

To establish a connection between Just Eat and HubRise via Just Eat Flyt Bridge, your restaurant must be a Just Eat partner with a store in Ireland or in the United Kingdom.
