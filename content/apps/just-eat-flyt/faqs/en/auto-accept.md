  description: This page explains the Just Eat Auto-Accept function when connecting the HubRise Just Eat Flyt Bridge.

If you do not want to use the Just Eat OrderPad, ask for Auto-Accept to be activated. When Auto-Accept is activated, orders are sent through HubRise directly to your connected EPOS, and you do not need to accept each order manually on the tablet.

Just Eat does not encourage Auto-Accept, because of the risk of missing orders.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Even with Auto-Accept activated, the OrderPad needs to remain switched on to keep the store open.

Auto-Accept is only available in the following markets:

- Ireland
- Italy
- Spain
- United Kingdom

France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland are on the Takeaway tech stack. Auto-Accept is not available for these markets, even with the Just Eat Flyt integration.
