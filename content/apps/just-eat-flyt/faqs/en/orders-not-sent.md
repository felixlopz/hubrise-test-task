If Just Eat Flyt Bridge is configured and you are not receiving orders, here are the most common reasons.

### Menu not Pushed

If you have not pushed your menu to Just Eat, you will not receive any orders. For more information on how to push your menu, see [Push the Catalog](/apps/just-eat-flyt/push-catalog).

### OrderPad not Switched on

The Just Eat OrderPad needs to remain switched on to receive orders in HubRise. For more information, see [Can I Turn Off the Orderpad?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept).

### Orders not Accepted

Orders must either be accepted manually in the OrderPad, or auto-accepted for them to be sent to HubRise. For more information, see [Do I Want Auto-Accept Activated?](/apps/just-eat-flyt/faqs/auto-accept).

### Orders not Sent to Kitchen

For markets under the Takeaway.com tech stack, orders need to be sent to the kitchen before they are sent to HubRise. This applies to the following markets:

- Just-Eat.ch
- Just-Eat.fr
- Takeaway.com (Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugual, Bulgaria, Romania)
- Thuisbezorgd.nl
- Lieferando (Germany, Austria)
- Pyszne.pl
- Vietnammm.com
