## Description

App4 is an online ordering system that lets restaurant customers place orders from their browser, from an app, or from their table. It provides a host of benefits to restaurants such as loyalty programs and table booking.

From the back office, restaurants can manage multiple aspects of their business: editing the restaurant's menu and delivery options, launch marketing operations and ensure they are paying off thanks to reports.

## Integration Features

Connecting App4 to HubRise allows the online ordering solution to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

App4 can be connected to HubRise via the App4 support line.
