- Login to the App4 back office.
- Click **HubRise Settings**.
- Select the restaurant to connect and click **Enable**.
- Click **Link to HubRise Account**.
- The next steps depend on whether you already have a HubRise location for the restaurant to connect. Refer to the corresponding section below.

### If you already have a HubRise location:

- If you are not logged in, HubRise will prompt for your email and password.
- App4 will then request permission to access your HubRise Location:

- Click **Allow** to complete the connection with HubRise.

### If don't have a HubRise location yet:

- When the HubRise login page is presented, click **No Account Yet?**.
- You will be prompted to create a new Account and Location. The **Account Name** is your brand name. The **Location Name** identifies the physical store: it should be the city or street where the restaurant is. For more information, see [Create an Account on HubRise](/docs/account/#create-an-account) and [Create a Location on HubRise](/docs/locations/#create-a-location).
- App4 will require permission to access your new HubRise Location. When prompted, click **Allow** to complete the connection.
