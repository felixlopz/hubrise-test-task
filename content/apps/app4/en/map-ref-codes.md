Most EPOS solutions require a ref code for each product to correctly parse orders. Therefore, when you create your menu on App4, you need to make sure that each product is assigned to the correct ref code.

You can manually assign ref codes to the items in your App4 menu, or [pull a HubRise catalog](/apps/app4/pull-catalog) directly in App4.

## Manually Assign Ref Codes to Products

To assign ref codes to your App4 products, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your App4 back office.

1. On the **Menu Setup** page, expand the category that contains the product that you want to edit, then click **Edit** next to the product.
1. Click the **HubRise** tab, then enter the ref code in the **HubRise Reference** field.
1. To confirm, click **Save**.
