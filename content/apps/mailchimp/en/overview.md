## Description

Mailchimp Bridge is an app developed by HubRise that allows the communication between HubRise and Mailchimp, the all‑in‑one marketing automation platform for small businesses.

Mailchimp Bridge can push customer information to Mailchimp every time a customer is created, or a customer information is updated in your HubRise account.

Mailchimp Bridge also provides a user interface to see the requests sent to Mailchimp and responses received. For more technical details about API requests and related responses, see [Understanding Logs](/apps/mailchimp/understanding-logs/).

## Prerequisites

To establish a successful connection between HubRise and Mailchimp, you require an active HubRise account, and an active Mailchimp account. You can sign up for free on the [Mailchimp website](https://mailchimp.com/). Connecting with HubRise is easy, and can be done in just a few minutes.

## Integration Features

The connection between Mailchimp Bridge and HubRise supports a one-way connection from HubRise to Mailchimp (push only integration). This means that information only flows from HubRise to Mailchimp, not vice versa. Therefore, Mailchimp Bridge cannot transfer customer data from Mailchimp to HubRise.

## Why Connect?

Mailchimp can be connected to HubRise for your online ordering site, your loyalty management solution and other apps connected to HubRise to send customer information to Mailchimp. This allows you to sync your customer information automatically. For more information on HubRise, see our [User Guide](/docs).
