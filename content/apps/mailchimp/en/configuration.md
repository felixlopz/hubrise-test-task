Once your HubRise account is connected to your Mailchimp account, your customer information will be pushed to Mailchimp automatically. Depending on your preferences, there are some options available to configure when the customer information is pushed to Mailchimp.

## Customer Export

If you have existing customers in your HubRise location at the time when you connect your HubRise account to Mailchimp, you can export the contacts to Mailchimp.

In order to export the existing customers to Mailchimp:

1. Open your Mailchimp Bridge. For assistance, see [Open An App](/docs/connections/#open-an-app).
1. In the top right hand corner, click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/009-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to your **Location name** and select **Configuration**.
1. In the **Actions** section, select **Export all HubRise customers to Mailchimp**.

All your existing customers will now be exported to Mailchimp.

## Configuration Options

For customers or orders which are added after you connect your HubRise account to Mailchimp, there are certain configuration options.

In order to configure your connection to Mailchimp:

1. Open your Mailchimp Bridge. For assistance, see [Open an App](/docs/connections/#open-an-app).

1. In the top right hand corner, click the down arrow <InlineImage width="28" height="21">![Down arrow icon](../images/009-arrow.jpg)</InlineImage> next to your **Location name** and select **Configuration**.

1. In the configuration section you have three options:

   - **Mailchimp account**: This option indicates which Mailchimp account is connected to your HubRise location.

   - **Mailchimp list**: This option indicates the Mailchimp Audience where the customers are exported to. In the drop-down list you will be able to select the list in your Mailchimp account which you want to use. The selected list will appear in the far right hand side of the Mailchimp header, immediately below the name of your business.

   - **Create a contact in Mailchimp when**: This option allows you to specify when a new contact should be created in Mailchimp. In the drop-down list you will be able to choose either **a customer is added to HubRise** or **an order is placed in HubRise**. Your choice specifies when a new customer is added as a contact in Mailchimp.

1. Once you have set the configuration according to your preferences, select **Save**.

In the **Configuration** section you also have the choice to **Reset the configuration**. This will reset the configuration to the default values.
