With Deliveroo Bridge, you can push your HubRise catalog into your Deliveroo store with a single click.

You can also configure the bridge to push your catalog into Deliveroo every time it is updated on HubRise. For more information, see [Catalog](/apps/deliveroo/configuration#catalog).

This page explains how to push your catalog, and what information is sent to Deliveroo.

## Populate a HubRise Catalog

To update your menu in Deliveroo, you should have a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, offer the ability to push their menu into HubRise. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

Alternatively, you can populate a HubRise catalog by pulling the menu from an existing Deliveroo or Uber Eats store. For more information, refer to these links:

- [Pull a Catalog from Deliveroo](/apps/deliveroo/pull-catalog)
- [Pull a Catalog from Uber Eats](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog)

## Manual Catalog Push

Once your catalog is populated on HubRise, and you have assigned ref codes to all products and options, you can push it manually to your Deliveroo store by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Deliveroo store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Deliveroo Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Deliveroo Bridge, select the **Actions** tab, then click **Push catalog**.
1. Check your Deliveroo online menu.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Pushing your HubRise catalog into Deliveroo will erase the current menu on your Deliveroo store, and replace your **Menu description** and **Menu banner** with the ones defined in the **Configuration** page. This action cannot be reverted. The catalog push will not work if ref codes are missing.

---

## Automatic Catalog Push

Deliveroo Bridge can automatically push your HubRise catalog into Deliveroo every time it is updated. By default, this option is turned off. You can enable it by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Deliveroo store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Deliveroo Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Deliveroo Bridge, select the **Configuration** tab.
1. In the **Catalog** section, tick the **Enable automatic catalog push** box.
1. Click **Save**.

## Information Sent to Deliveroo {#information-sent}

The following sections provide more details on how your HubRise catalog is mapped to Deliveroo.

You can specify the menu description and upload your banner image directly from the [Configuration page](/apps/deliveroo/configuration).

Deliveroo Bridge sends this information to Deliveroo with every catalog push.

### Categories

Deliveroo Bridge maps HubRise categories one-to-one to categories of products on Deliveroo.

- Sku name

For products with multiple skus, Deliveroo Bridge creates a product, a modifier list, and one modifier for each sku.

The order in which categories and products appear on HubRise is maintained on Deliveroo.

- `ref`: The ref of the sku, which will be passed along in orders
- `name`: The name of the sku
- `price`: The price difference with the main product, if present

### Deals

For each deal in the catalog, Deliveroo Bridge creates a Deliveroo product with the following details:
