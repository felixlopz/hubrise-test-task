Connecting Deliveroo to HubRise can be done with a few simple steps.

## 1. Enable HubRise on Deliveroo

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your Deliveroo account.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link(s) of your Deliveroo store(s) you wish to connect. For example: [https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham).
- The URL link of your Deliveroo back office when you are logged in. We will use it to obtain your Deliveroo Restaurant ID. For more details, see our FAQ: [How Do I Find My Deliveroo Restaurant ID](/apps/deliveroo/faqs/find-deliveroo-restaurant-id).
- The email address you logged in the Deliveroo back office and use to communicate with Deliveroo.
- The email address of your Deliveroo account manager.
- Your HubRise account and location IDs. If you don't have a HubRise Account, go to the [HubRise Signup](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup) page and follow the instructions. If your restaurant called Fast Pizza is located in Baker Street, your location ID may be `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

We will then contact Deliveroo on your behalf to enable the connection.
The activation typically takes less than one week.

## 3. Configure Your Preferences

After connecting the bridge, you need to configure a few parameters on the Configuration page to send orders correctly to your EPOS.

For more information about the Configuration page and how to navigate to it, see [User Interface](/apps/deliveroo/user-interface/#configuration-page). For details on how to configure the parameters of Deliveroo Bridge, see [Configuration](/apps/deliveroo/configuration).

## 4. Map Products to Ref Codes

If you use Deliveroo with an EPOS, you need to map all the products in your Deliveroo menu to their corresponding ref codes. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

To learn how to map ref codes on Deliveroo, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/deliveroo/map-ref-codes).
