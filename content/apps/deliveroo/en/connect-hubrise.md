Connecting Deliveroo to HubRise can be done with a few simple steps.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you don't already have a HubRise account, start by registering on the [HubRise Signup Page](https://manager.hubrise.com/signup). It only takes a minute!

---

## 1. Enable HubRise on Deliveroo

As a first step, the HubRise integration must be enabled on your Deliveroo account.

Contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) and include the following information in your email:

- The URL link to your restaurant page on the Deliveroo website. For example: [https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/london/clapham/camile-thai-clapham).
- The Deliveroo Restaurant ID of the store. For more details, see our FAQ: [How Do I Find My Deliveroo Restaurant ID](/apps/deliveroo/faqs/find-deliveroo-restaurant-id).
- The email address you use to log in to the Deliveroo back office.
- The email address of your Deliveroo account manager.
- Whether your Deliveroo store is connected to another middleware or EPOS.
- The service type(s) you support on Deliveroo: Delivery by Deliveroo, Restaurant delivery, Takeaway. For more information, see [Service Types](/apps/deliveroo/terminology#service-types).
- Your HubRise location name and identifier. For example: `Fast Pizza Baker Street z6q31-0`.

With this information in hand, the Deliveroo integration team will enable the HubRise connection for your store. New connections are approved on Tuesdays and Thursdays only.

Alternatively, [enable HubRise directly from your Deliveroo back office](/apps/deliveroo/faqs/connect-from-deliveroo-back-office).

## 3. Configure Your Preferences

After connecting the bridge, you need to configure a few parameters on the Configuration page to send orders correctly to your EPOS.

For more information about the Configuration page and how to navigate to it, see [User Interface](/apps/deliveroo/user-interface/#configuration-page). For details on how to configure the parameters of Deliveroo Bridge, see [Configuration](/apps/deliveroo/configuration).

## 4. Map Products Ref Codes

Each product in Deliveroo needs to have a corresponding ref code. This ensures that your EPOS can identify every item correctly.

To learn how to map ref codes on Deliveroo, see [Map Ref Codes](/apps/deliveroo/map-ref-codes).

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Deliveroo will not enable the HubRise connection if some product ref codes are missing.
