If you want to leave the Deliveroo tablet aside to free up your restaurant staff and avoid the risk of order rejections, you have two options available.

## Set Up Tabletless Mode

The first option is to configure the integration for tabletless mode. To activate this mode, contact us at [support@hubrise.com](mailto:support@hubrise.com) or reach out to your Deliveroo Account Manager.

Once activated, there's no need to keep the Deliveroo tablet on or even to have one at the restaurant at all.

The tabletless mode can create more counter space, which is especially beneficial if you manage multiple brands on Deliveroo from the same location. It is also essential if you operate a ghost kitchen.

## Enable Auto-Accept

The second option is to enable auto-accept by selecting **Turn on Auto-accept** on your Deliveroo tablet each day when you open your restaurant.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** With auto-accept enabled, you need to keep the tablet turned on to receive orders on HubRise or your connected EPOS.

You can also toggle auto-accept at any time from the tablet's **Settings** page.
