To connect your Deliveroo store to HubRise by yourself, first activate HubRise from the Deliveroo back office, then connect Deliveroo Bridge to your HubRise location.

To activate HubRise on the Deliveroo back-office, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Deliveroo back office](https://restaurant-hub.deliveroo.net).
1. Click **Integrations**.
1. Under **Which POS system do you use?**, enter `HubRise`.
1. From the list of sites, select all the locations you want to connect, and for each site, enter the corresponding **Site location ID**.
1. Decide if you wish to manage your Deliveroo menu from the EPOS:
   - To update your menu by pushing the HubRise catalog to Deliveroo, choose **Yes**. For more information, see [Push Catalog](/apps/deliveroo/push-catalog).
   - To update your menu manually from the Deliveroo back office, choose **No**.
1. Verify that all items in your menu are assigned a PLU code.
1. Click **Connect your till (POS)** to confirm.

To connect Deliveroo Bridge to the HubRise location associated with the Deliveroo store, see [Connect Deliveroo Bridge](/apps/deliveroo/connect-hubrise#connect).
