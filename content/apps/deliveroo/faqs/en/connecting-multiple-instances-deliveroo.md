It is possible to connect multiple Deliveroo stores to the same HubRise location.

This can be helpful if you intend to receive all Deliveroo orders in the same EPOS, regardless of the store they originate from.
It is also useful when you intend to support deliveries by Deliveroo and by the restaurant simultaneously. For more details on Deliveroo service types, see our [Terminology](/apps/deliveroo/terminology#service-types).

Connect multiple instances of Deliveroo Bridge to the same HubRise location by following the instructions in the [HubRise documentation](/docs/faqs/connect-multiple-instances-same-app). For each new connection, you should specify the Deliveroo Location ID for the Deliveroo store you want to connect.
