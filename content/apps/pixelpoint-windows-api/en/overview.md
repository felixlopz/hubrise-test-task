## Description

PixelPoint Windows API is an app developed by Slowey Systems that allows the communication between HubRise and the PAR PixelPoint EPOS.

It takes any incoming order in HubRise, converts it into the PixelPoint format and sends it to the POS.

## Prerequisites

To establish a successful connection with your PAR PixelPoint EPOS, PixelPoint Windows API requires a server running in your store with the following apps:

- Windows OS
- Pixel SQLbase
- Pixel License Manager

PixelPoint Windows API also requires another server, managed by Slowey Systems, which is necessary to establish the connection between HubRise and the store server.
