OrderLord supports GPS coordinates for your delivery orders. If a HubRise order contains latitude and longitude for the customer's address, this information is sent to your OrderLord EPOS.

The majority of food delivery and online ordering platforms send GPS coordinates to HubRise. If this information does not appear in your OrderLord EPOS, it is likely that the online ordering solution you are using does not support this feature.
