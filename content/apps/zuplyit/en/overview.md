## Description

Zuplyit by AirTouchMedia offers a branded online ordering website and mobile app alongside its own Delivery Management System (DMS). Zuplyit also comes with loyalty and promotional tools to help maximise new customer acquisition, increase purchase frequency and average ticket size. Zuplyit serves the needs of medium and large restaurant chains.

Zuplyit has a direct integration with food ordering and delivery platforms (Uber Eats, Just Eat and Glovo). Menus are pushed from Zuplyit into the platforms. Orders are managed within Zuplyit, and delivered with the help of the Delivery Management System.

## Integration Features

Connecting Zuplyit to HubRise allows your online ordering solution to:

- Push orders into HubRise, including order status.
- Push customer information into HubRise.
- Pull the menu from a HubRise catalog.

Zuplyit can be connected to HubRise from the Zuplyit back office.

## Why Connect?

By connecting Zuplyit to HubRise, your online ordering solution can communicate with your other everyday applications. Send online orders to your EPOS, to an autonomous printer, a Kitchen Display Screen, or to your inventory management solution.

Thanks to HubRise, you can synchronise your menu, your customer information and your orders with your EPOS, your online ordering solution, food delivery platforms (including Deliveroo, Uber Eats and Just Eat), delivery management solutions or delivery services, eMarketing (SMS/emailing), business intelligence, inventory management and customer loyalty systems, and more. The number of compatible applications increases every month. To see which apps you can connect, see our [Apps page](/apps).
