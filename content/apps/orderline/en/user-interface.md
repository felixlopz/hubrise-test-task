## View Today's Orders

When OrderLine fetches an Order from HubRise with the same delivery date as the current day, it displays an order counter notification on the top right-hand corner of the corresponding tab and plays a notification sound to alert the user.

Orders may be hidden depending on the **Hide Order Status** setting. These Orders can be seen from **Today's Orders** tab by selecting **View** on the hidden order card. For more information, see [Order Status](/apps/orderline/settings/#set-order-statuses).

## View Future Orders

When OrderLine fetches an order with the delivery date in the future, it displays an order counter next to the OrderLine's **FUTURE ORDERS** tab. It also plays a notification sound to alert the user that a new order has been received.

## Check Orders History

OrderLine aggregates today's orders, future orders, and all orders completed in the last 30 days in a list. To view this list, click **ORDERS HISTORY**.

Orders are displayed in descending order by date, with the most recent date first.

You may filter orders by a combination of:

- Customer name or Order reference.
- Delivery date range.
