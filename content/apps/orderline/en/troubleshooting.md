## I cannot hear orders coming in

On mobile devices, make sure to disable Auto-Lock in your display settings. Plugging in your device might also help.

We recommend using Google Chrome.

## My browser displays a blank page when I launch OrderLine

If you have the ad blocker uBlock Origin installed on your browser, make sure to disable it. OrderLine does not work with this extension.
