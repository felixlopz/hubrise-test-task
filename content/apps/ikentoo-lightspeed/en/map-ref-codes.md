## Menu Setup

iKentoo Bridge is a _push-only_ integration. For this reason, menu items must be manually set in the system to connect with their corresponding ref codes to ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and iKentoo.

### Finding ref codes

To find ref codes in the iKentoo back-office:

- Open the **Items** page from the **Configuration** Menu.
- The ref codes to copy are in the **Code** column:

- Click on the **Export** button:
