Most EPOS solutions require a ref code for each product to correctly parse orders. Therefore, when you create your menu on Just Eat Takeaway, you need to make sure that each product is assigned to the correct ref code.

To assign ref codes to your products, contact your Just Eat Takeaway account manager and provide them with the list of products and ref codes from your EPOS.

Alternatively, you can map ref codes autonomously from the back office of your Just Eat Takeaway Partner Portal. Navigate to the **Menu** tab and fill in the ref codes in the empty fields.
The following screenshot illustrates how to enter ref codes in the back office.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The exact steps of the update procedure might vary between the local Just Eat Takeaway platforms. Contact your Just Eat Takeaway account manager to verify.
