## Language

Choose the language to use for generic items such as `Delivery charge`. These names may appear in your EPOS and in customer receipts.

## Service Types

Service types such as delivery by the platform, restaurant delivery or takeaway might require the corresponding ref code entry. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

Additionally, from this section you can choose to mark Just Eat orders as delivery orders or collection orders.
This is useful if you have specific business requirements for financial reporting.

## Discounts

This section allows you to specify the discount ref code applied to your products, in case you have one active on your Just Eat Takeaway store. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to see how to obtain the corresponding ref code.

## Charges

If charges apply, a ref code might be required. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website to verify.

In this section, you can specify the ref code for delivery charges applied by the delivery platform.

## Payments

Just Eat Takeaway customers can pay for their order either online or by cash for restaurant delivery orders.

This section of the configuration page allows you to specify the ref codes for these two payment methods. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the [Apps page](/apps) to verify the correct codes to use.

## Order Statuses

Just Eat Takeaway requires you to mark every successful order as `confirmed`. In this section, you can select which HubRise status change is used to send the confirmation to Just Eat Takeaway.
