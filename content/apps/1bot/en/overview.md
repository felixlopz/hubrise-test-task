## Description

1Bot allows restaurateurs and retailers to set up personal assistant chatbots on their website.

1Bot chatbots can provide the establishment's menu and business hours, take orders and bookings, or answer questions. Many other features are available.

1Bot sends a summary of each conversation to the establishment by SMS.

1Bot chatbots are active 24/7, even outside the establishment's business hours.
