  description: Instructions on mapping the PAR PixelPoint EPOS product ref codes with other apps after connecting your EPOS with HubRise. Synchronise your data.

PixelPoint Bridge pushes but is not able to pull information stored in the PAR PixelPoint EPOS. For this reason, all menu items and prices must be manually set in the system to connect with their corresponding product code and ensure a smooth communication between HubRise and PixelPoint.

Every order received in HubRise is forwarded to the EPOS via PixelPoint Bridge. For the transaction to work, products within the catalog, service types (delivery, collection, eat-in) and payment methods should be mapped. For a detailed description of how to map the EPOS ref codes in the system connected to HubRise, see [Mapping Ref codes](/apps/pixelpoint/map-ref-codes).
