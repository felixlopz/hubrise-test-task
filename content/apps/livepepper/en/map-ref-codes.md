For LivePepper orders to be processed by your EPOS, you need to configure ref codes for each item in the menu, including toppings and options, ingredients, product sizes and deals. In some cases, the EPOS will also require ref codes for payment methods, service types and delivery charges. Refer to your EPOS documentation on the HubRise website for details.

This page explains how to configure these different ref codes in LivePepper.

## Product

The full product catalog can be pulled from HubRise into LivePepper. For more information, see [Pulling the Menu](/apps/livepepper/menu#pulling-the-menu). 
If you cannot import the catalog from HubRise, you will need to map product EPOS ref codes manually in LivePepper. The first step is to export a list of EPOS ref codes from your EPOS system. This may be exported as a CSV or Excel file. Whatever format they are exported to, the next step will be to copy those codes into LivePepper.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is important for each POS code field available in LivePepper to be mapped with the corresponding EPOS ref codes. If the EPOS ref code is missing, the EPOS will not be unable to correctly process the order.

---

LivePepper could insert those EPOS ref codes for you, if contracted to do so. See your LivePepper support representative for more information.

### Add EPOS Ref Codes to Toppings, Variants, Ingredients, and Options

The process to add EPOS ref codes to toppings, variants, ingredients, and options is the same for product categories and products.

- Product **Category** values include:

  - **Variants**: Variants are available differences in a product. For example: Pizza with thin crust versus pizza with hand tossed crust.
  - **Toppings**: Ingredients that customers can add to their product that are not available by default. For example, adding mushrooms to a cheeseburger. Toppings can be set at the product category or the product level.
  - **Options**: Options are differences in how products are delivered. For example: Adding utensils, sauces, cutting a pizza in squares instead of triangles, etc.

- **Products** values and attributes include:
  - **Ingredients**: Default ingredients within a recipe that customers can remove from their product. For example: Cheeseburger without the pickles.
  - **Price & Availability**: The options made available to the customer, usually in the form of sizes. For example: an 8" pizza versus a 12” pizza.
  - **Toppings**: Ingredients set at the product category or the product level.

The instructions below are specific to updating the EPOS ref codes for a product's ingredients, and can be replicated for the items listed above.

To update the EPOS code for each product ingredient:

1. Select the product.
1. Select the **Ingredients** row.
1. Select the ingredient to update.
1. For each **Price & availability** option, enter the **POS code**.
1. If the ingredient is used in other products and they share the same EPOS code, they can be copied with the **Quick Copy** setting:
   1. From the dropdown select whether the Toppings apply to **All menu** items, or all products in a category.
   2. Click **Use POS codes above**. If the toppings share the same cost and availability, those options can be checked as well.
