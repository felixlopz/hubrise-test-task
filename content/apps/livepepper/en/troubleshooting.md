## Verify Product Mapping {#verify-mapping}

To confirm that every LivePepper menu item has an associated EPOS code, navigate to **Maintenance** > **Custom Actions** from the left navigation panel. Among the various reports displayed, you'll find one labeled **Missing POS codes**. This report lists all products, deals, and their related attributes lacking assigned EPOS ref codes.

Please note that missing EPOS ref codes for payment methods, service types, and delivery charges will not be reported in this section. Not all EPOS systems require these codes, so their absence isn't necessarily indicative of an error.

## Verify the Connection to HubRise

These steps require that you have already connected LivePepper to HubRise. For more information on connecting LivePepper to HubRise, see [Connect to HubRise](/apps/livepepper/connect-hubrise).
