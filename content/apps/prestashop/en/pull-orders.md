  description: Find out the technical details of how orders are pulled from PrestaShop into HubRise, which fields are passed and which are not.
---

Connecting PrestaShop to HubRise allows you to receive orders directly in your EPOS or any other solution connected to your HubRise account.

This page describes the information that HubRise receives from PrestaShop for your orders.

## Items, Options, and Deals

PrestaShop orders contain the complete information about items, including name, POS ref code, quantity, and price. Options and deals, however, are not supported.

## Order Statuses

When an order status changes in HubRise, PrestaShop Bridge notifies PrestaShop, and the change can be seen by the customer.

From the Configuration page of PrestaShop Bridge, you can customise how to map the different HubRise order statuses to PrestaShop. To learn how to map order statuses in the Configuration page, see [Order Statuses](/apps/prestashop/configuration#order-statuses).

## Service Types

PrestaShop Bridge sends to HubRise the information about the carrier used for the delivery. From the Configuration page, you can customise the ref code associated with each carrier. To learn how to set ref code for service types, see [Service Types](/apps/prestashop/configuration#service-types).

## Customer Details

PrestaShop provides full customer's details for all orders. PrestaShop Bridge creates a customer in HubRise every time you receive an order from a new customer, and the customer's details are reused or updated in the following orders.

## Discounts and Charges

PrestaShop Bridge provides information about discounts and delivery charges, if present.

## Technical Reference
