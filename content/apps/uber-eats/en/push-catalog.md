With Uber Eats Bridge, you can push your HubRise catalog into your Uber Eats store with a single click.

You can also configure the bridge to push your catalog to Uber Eats every time it is updated on HubRise. For more information, see [Catalog](/apps/uber-eats/configuration#catalog).

This page explains how to push your catalog, and what information is sent to Uber Eats.

## Populate a HubRise Catalog

To update your menu in Uber Eats, you should have a HubRise catalog first. Many apps connected with HubRise, including EPOS solutions, online ordering solutions and food ordering and delivery platforms offer the ability to push their menu into HubRise. Refer to your app documentation on the HubRise [Apps page](/apps) to verify.

Alternatively, you can populate a HubRise catalog by pulling the menu from an existing Deliveroo or Uber Eats store. For more information, refer to these links:

- [Pull a Catalog from Deliveroo](/apps/deliveroo/pull-catalog)
- [Pull a Catalog from Uber Eats](/apps/uber-eats/pull-catalog)

## Manual Catalog Push

Once your catalog is populated on HubRise, you can push it manually to your Uber Eats store by following these steps:

1. Log in to your [HubRise account](https://manager.hubrise.com).
1. Select the HubRise account and location connected with your Uber Eats store.
1. Open the **CONNECTIONS** page, then select **Uber Eats Bridge** from the list of connected apps.
1. In Uber Eats Bridge, select the **Actions** tab, check the name and the ID of the HubRise catalog, then click **Push catalog**.
1. Check your Uber Eats online menu.
