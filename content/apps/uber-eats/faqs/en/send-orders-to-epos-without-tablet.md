Uber Eats allows you to configure how you receive orders in many different ways.
This page explains the different available options that you can request during the initial connection with HubRise.

## Acceptance Mode

Uber Eats allows restaurants to receive orders in two different modes: **manual accept** and **offered state**.

- With **manual accept** mode, new orders need to be accepted on Uber Eats tablet first, and after that they are sent to the EPOS.
- With **offered state** mode, new orders are directly sent to the EPOS, and they need to be accepted or rejected there.

Uber Eats controls which mode is activated on your store from their back office.

HubRise supports both modes seemlessly. Let us know which mode suits your business needs best during the initial configuration. For more information, see [Connect to HubRise](/apps/uber-eats/connect-hubrise).

If you do not specify your preferred mode, your store will use the offered state mode by default.
However, we recommend that you start in manual accept mode for a few weeks regardless, to make sure that your setup works as expected, and later switch to offered state mode. At any moment, you can switch to a different mode by contacting your Uber Eats Account Manager.

## Switching Off the Tablet

Uber Eats provides a feature called **RD-optional** that allows you to decide if you want to keep using your tablet after connecting with HubRise.

- If you want to stop using your tablet, enable RD-optional.
- If you want to keep using your tablet, disable RD-optional.

By default, you must keep your tablet on to be able to receive orders, even if you enable offered state as your acceptance mode. You can stop using your tablet by enabling RD-optional.

## Cancelling Failed Orders Automatically

You can decide to automatically cancel orders that cannot be sent to your EPOS by enabling the **auto-cancel** feature.
Your customers will be notified whenever their order is cancelled.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you enable RD-optional, Uber Eats recommends to enable auto-cancel, too.
