## Description

Barratio provides restaurateurs with an overview of their business by analysing purchases, costs and sales data.

Barratio can be used to calculate the cost and profitability of each recipe, and keep the theoretical stock up to date. Fifteen dashboards offer detailed visibility of the establishment's activity.

Barratio can be used to digitise and automatically reconcile invoices and delivery orders. By making it easy to compare prices with different suppliers, Barratio helps to optimise purchases.

Barratio can be used to export purchasing and sales data to an accounting software solution.

Barratio runs on desktop PCs, tablets and smartphones.
